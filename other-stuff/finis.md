What have you learned?
- (Almost) everything is in `.git/`
- The git repo is a content-addressable filesystem
- You can extend **git** with aliases and new subcommands
- You can understand **git** with little experiments,
on tiny, scratch repos.

There's a lot more that's important:

- the staging area
- git stash
- logs
- symbolic references
- git gc
- how trees and commits happen
- merges
- workflow, tools, and best practices
- how **git** got where it is, and where **git** is going
- large-file management
- ...

Really a lot. With the time we had, this is a good start.

Where else can you learn about this?

- googling, and the valves and tubes of the interwebs. Here are some sites I like:
  - [beautiful git visualization](http://www.wei-wang.com/ExplainGitWithD3/)
  - [how to solve git problems](http://justinhileman.info/article/git-pretty/)
  - [a free, basic tutorial](https://try.github.io)
  - [a not-free, but good follow-on to that tutorial](https://www.codeschool.com/paths/git)

- experiments: don't be afraid to do them
- me

Pearson asked me to make [some videos, which you can buy.](http://goo.gl/QJIFxo)
You have my number. You have my email address. Call or write.

I have a day job,
but if you work for a company that needs help,
have them contact me.
We can arrange advice, training, or consulting,
or I can point them at someone who'd be a better fit.

Untill then, Happy Trails.
